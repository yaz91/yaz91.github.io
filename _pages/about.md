I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the College of William and Mary. I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. I studied at the University of Science and Technology of China, the University of Chinese Academy of Science, and the University of Rochester. My research interests include machine learning, data mining, and computer vision.
